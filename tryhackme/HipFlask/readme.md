## Task 1

Introduction Deploy! (deply the machine)

## Task 2

Introduction Outline

Hip Flask is a beginner to intermediate level walkthrough. It aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the thought-processes involved in attacking an exposed webserver hosting a custom application in a penetration testing context.

Specifically, this room will look at exploiting a Python Flask application via two very distinctive flaws to gain remote code execution on the server. A simple privilege escalation will then be carried out resulting in full root access over the target.

The tasks in this room will cover every step of the attack process in detail, including providing possible remediations for the vulnerabilities found.  There are no explicit pre-requisites to cover before attempting this room; however, further resources will be linked at relevant sections should you wish further practice with the topic in question. That said, knowledge of Python and basic hacking fundamentals will come in handy. When in doubt: research!

Firefox is highly recommended for the web portion of this room. Use a different browser if you like, but be warned that any and all troubleshooting notes will be aimed at Firefox.
